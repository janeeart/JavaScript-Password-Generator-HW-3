# JavaScript-Password-Generator-HW-3

This is a modification of starter code for a web application. This web application enables employees with access to sensitive data to generate random passwords based on selected criteria. The purpose of the modification is to provide greater security with strong passwords.

## Description

In this project, I modified a website by improving he functionality of a password generator. Once the page button is clicked, and the user is presented with a series of prompts to choose from in order to create a strong password. The user must choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. The user can then choose to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in their password. The user input is validated and at least one character type is applied to the generated password. A password is generated that matches the selected critera and it is written to the textarea on the page. This web application applies recently learned Javascript skills.
